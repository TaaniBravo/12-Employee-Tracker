Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

### USER STORY

## Installation
    1. ```npm init``` to install package.json.
    2. ```npm i``` to install the necessary packages to run file.
    3. Run ```employee_tracker_db.sql``` in your SQL server to create DB.
    4. (Optional) Run ```seed.sql``` to get a sample employee roster
    5. If you opt to create your roster from scratch you will NEED to ADD a department, role, and then employee in this order. Otherwise program will not work as the CLI works dynamically with the tables.

## Usage
![example image]()

    This program is great for keeping track of a roster of employees, their company information, and updating the company of employees added/removed.

Anthony Brown (Instructor) - Anthony showed us in class a great way to modularize our program and in turn really made this homework a lot more understandable then when I initial tried to work through it completely blind.
